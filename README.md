# Authentication-authorization-API
Authentication is knowing the identity of the user. For example, Alice logs in with her username and password, and the server uses the password to authenticate Alice. Authorization is deciding whether a user is allowed to perform an action. For example, Alice has permission to get a resource but not create a resource.
